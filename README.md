## How WebP Saves Space
The WebP image format offers superior compression without sacrificing quality compared to traditional formats like JPG or PNG. Here's an estimated space savings:

- For JPG files: Savings typically range from 25% to 34% compared to the original JPG files.
- For PNG files: Space savings can be even greater, up to 45% or more, especially for images with large areas of uniform color.
